      <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.
        Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name.A good reference examples are like Ghana's first president
        <strong> Kwame Nkrumah</strong>. And the  former United Nations Secretary-General <strong>Kofi Annan.</strong>
